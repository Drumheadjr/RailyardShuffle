# Coding Procedure.

1. Review existing code in depth. Always take in to account existing patterns and structures in the code base.
2. Based on your review. Create a task list with your implementation plan.
3. Execute the task list.
4. Review your work. Does it solve the original problem? Is the code clean and maintainable? Is there any extra code that you no longer need?
5. Test the result. If it doesn't work. Go back to step 3. Never modify tests just to make your code work.
6. Cleanup temporary tests, if you created any temporary test files.

# General 
- If you become confused at any point. Always ask the user for clarification. 
- Only perform the requested changes. Do not imagine what the user wants. Ask the user for clarification on anything you think is missing.
