# Level Select Menu Bug Fix

## Issue Description

The level select menu buttons were not functional when accessed directly from the main menu. The buttons would only work after a level had been started and exited, making the level select menu essentially broken on first access.

## Root Cause Analysis

The bug was located in the `GameEngine.ts` file, specifically in the `gameLoop` method (lines 105-109). The issue was with the game state logic that controlled when scenes could run.

### Original Problematic Code
```typescript
private gameLoop = (currentTime: number): void => {
  const gameData = this.gameStateManager.getGameData();
  if (!gameData.isRunning && this.gameStateManager.getCurrentState() === GameStateType.MAIN_MENU) {
    // Allow main menu to run even when game is not "running"
  } else if (!gameData.isRunning) {
    return; // ❌ This blocked LEVEL_SELECT when isRunning = false
  }
  // ... rest of game loop
};
```

### The Problem Flow
1. **Initial State**: `isRunning = false`, `currentState = MAIN_MENU`
2. **Main Menu Works**: The condition allowed MAIN_MENU to run when `isRunning = false`
3. **Level Select Blocked**: When transitioning to LEVEL_SELECT, `isRunning` was still `false`, so the game loop would return early and skip input handling and updates
4. **After Playing a Level**: `isRunning` became `true` during gameplay, and remained `true` when returning to level select
5. **Level Select Now Works**: Because `isRunning = true`, the level select scene could now process input

## Solution

Updated the game loop logic to allow both menu states (MAIN_MENU and LEVEL_SELECT) to run even when the game is not in a "running" state.

### Fixed Code
```typescript
private gameLoop = (currentTime: number): void => {
  const gameData = this.gameStateManager.getGameData();
  const currentState = this.gameStateManager.getCurrentState();
  
  // Allow menu states to run even when game is not "running"
  const menuStates = [GameStateType.MAIN_MENU, GameStateType.LEVEL_SELECT];
  if (!gameData.isRunning && !menuStates.includes(currentState)) {
    return;
  }
  // ... rest of game loop
};
```

## Key Changes

1. **Added State Check**: Now checks the current state instead of just allowing MAIN_MENU
2. **Menu States Array**: Defined which states should be allowed to run when `isRunning = false`
3. **Inclusive Logic**: Both MAIN_MENU and LEVEL_SELECT can now run regardless of the `isRunning` flag
4. **Future-Proof**: Easy to add other menu states (like SETTINGS, PAUSE_MENU, etc.) to the array

## Testing the Fix

### Before Fix
1. Start game → Main Menu (works)
2. Click "LEVEL SELECT" → Level Select Menu (buttons don't work)
3. Press ESC → Back to Main Menu
4. Start any level → Play level → Exit level
5. Click "LEVEL SELECT" → Level Select Menu (buttons now work)

### After Fix
1. Start game → Main Menu (works)
2. Click "LEVEL SELECT" → Level Select Menu (buttons work immediately)
3. Can navigate between levels without needing to play a level first

## Impact

- **Zero Breaking Changes**: All existing functionality preserved
- **Immediate Fix**: Level select buttons work on first access
- **Better UX**: Players can browse levels without being forced to play one first
- **Maintainable**: Clear separation of menu states vs gameplay states

## Files Modified

- `src/game/GameEngine.ts` - Fixed game loop logic to allow menu states

## Related Components

- `LevelSelectScene.ts` - The scene that was being blocked
- `GameStateManager.ts` - Manages the game state transitions
- `MainMenuScene.ts` - Works correctly (was the reference for the fix)

This fix ensures that all menu-related scenes can function properly regardless of whether the game is in an active "running" state, providing a much better user experience.
